\label{sub:fulltime}
\tlcventry{2016}{0}{Sr. Software Engineer, Trade Automation \& Execution}{Bloomberg}{NY, USA}{}
{
\begin{tightitemize}
	\item Developed several full-stack trade automation and execution applications used daily by global enterprise clients on the Bloomberg Terminal. \textit{Stack: C++/Python backend, TypeScript frontend, using various internal and OSS frameworks including Apache Spark, RabbitMQ.}
	\item Provided technical leadership in several key areas including systems design of a modular architecture to improve robustness and maintainability as we scaled to hundreds of brokers.
	\item Worked closely with product managers to translate customer/business needs into functional requirements that reduced technical risk and allowed timely delivery of products and features.
\end{tightitemize}
}

\label{sub:fulltime}
\tlcventry{2013}{2016}{R\&D Engineer, Systems and Controls}{Quanser Inc}{ON, Canada}{}
{
\begin{tightitemize}
	\item Developed a native iOS/Android app platform geared towards STEM, including support for control system tools, mathematical solvers, dynamic systems simulations \& OpenGL visualizations. \textit{Stack: C\#/Java/Objective-C frontend \& ASP.NET/Node.js REST backend.}
	\item Designed the entire system from the ground up, starting from the initial framework architecture through to productionisation and iterative releases via continuous deployment.
\end{tightitemize}
}


\label{sub:postgrad}
\tlcventry{2010}{2012}{NSERC Industrial Postgraduate Scholar}{UWaterloo \& Quanser Inc}{ON, Canada}{}
{
\begin{tightitemize}
	\item Developed a dynamic multibody model and electromechanical design of a 14DOF bipedal robot for the research in humanoid gait. \textit{Stack: SolidWorks, MATLAB/Simulink.}
	\item Published a software toolchain to auto-generate full dynamics simulations and 3D visualizations for multibody systems from CAD, drastically improving mechatronic design iterations.
\end{tightitemize}
}

\label{sub:coop}
\tlcventry{2009}{2009}{Hardware Engineer (Coop)}{Arista Networks Inc}{CA, USA}{}
{
\begin{tightitemize}
	\item Analyzed, modeled and detected signal integrity issues on high speed (10Gb/s) printed circuit board traces on prototype hardware in a lab.
	\item Aided with the electromechanical design and published specifications for a hardware test system to be used by the contract manufacturers on the production line.
\end{tightitemize}
}

\tlcventry{2008}{2008}{Advanced Technical Work Engineer (Coop)}{General Motors}{ON, Canada}{}
{
\begin{tightitemize}
	\item Developed software prototypes for three R\&D projects which allowed iOS applications to remotely (e.g. over 3G) control vehicle functionality through the CAN bus.
	\item Proposed and designed an innovative software platform for further prototype development which saved GM Canada over \$100,000 as a side project during the four month work-term.
